# CIS-419-project-hate-speech
Our project  focuses on solving the problem of what is the best hate speech detection algorithm for tweets. After we had our data preprocessed we used the following models to be trained on the data: Decision Tree Classifier, Adaboost Classifier, Logistic Regression, Linear Regression, Random Forest (with gini index and with entropy), K-means, 3 ensemble methods, and 5 CNN models.
